# Deployment Progress

## Status: Ready for Cloud Deployment

### Completed Steps
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ Project built successfully (npm run build)
- ✅ Dockerfile created for containerization
- ✅ Azure infrastructure as code (Bicep) created
- ✅ Azure.yaml configuration created
- ✅ All deployment files committed to repository

### Azure Resources to be Deployed
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Azure Container Apps (ACA)
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Application Insights
- User-Assigned Managed Identity

### Next Steps
The project is ready for deployment. You can deploy using one of these methods:

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Automated)
A GitHub Actions workflow has been created at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Simply push to main branch and it will:
1. Build the Docker image
2. Push to Azure Container Registry
3. Deploy to Azure Container Apps

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment with AZD
```bash
# Install Azure CLI and AZD
# https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd

# Initialize AZD environment
azd env new

# Set your subscription
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your-subscription-id>

# Provision infrastructure
azd provision

# Deploy application
azd up
```

#### Option 3: Manual Deployment with Azure CLI
The Bicep template can also be deployed directly using Azure CLI.

### Deployment Configuration
- **Application Name**: ConstitutionVerse
- **Container Port**: 3000
- **Base Image**: node:18-alpine
- **Registry**: Azure Container Registry
- **Hosting**: Azure Container Apps

### Key Files
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Docker build
- `azure.yaml` - AZD configuration
- `infra/main.bicep` - Azure infrastructure template
- `infra/main.parameters.json` - Deployment parameters

### Notes
- The application uses the Consumption plan for cost optimization
- Auto-scaling is configured (1-3 replicas)
- Application Insights monitoring is enabled
- All traffic goes through Azure Container Apps ingress controller
